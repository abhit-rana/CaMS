# CaS
This a Project Repo we made during the Anveshan Hackathon'22 at IIITD where we made a Chatbot for Mental Health Support and Visual Monitoring System which sees whether the person is all right or facing pain.

Chatbot

It is made by using the code of Hugging Face at Conversational Intelligence Challenge 2 (ConvAI2), a dialog competition at NeurIPS 2018[https://medium.com/huggingface/how-to-build-a-state-of-the-art-conversational-ai-with-transfer-learning-2d818ac26313]. We understood their code and modified our dataset for making the code and dataset compatible with the code. The chatbot uses Transfer Learning to build a State-of-the-Art dialog agent based on OpenAI GPT and GPT-2 Transformer language models.

Dataset Used: data from counselchat.com [(https://github.com/nbertagnolli/counsel-chat)]

Monitoring System
We used vision Transformer model and fine tuned on our dataset to identify whether the person is suffering from pain or not.
