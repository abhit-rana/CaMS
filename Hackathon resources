Chatbot

Any chatbot has three components:
Natural Language Understanding(NLU)-is about entity or actions extractions from the conversation or user query; Dialogue Management(DM)-is mainly Reinforcement Learning and is the agent(Like in AI) taking the most appropriate actions from the set of many and NLG(Natural Language Generation) converting the final action by the DM into the Human Language as a response.
TASK:
FINDING THE RIGHT DATASET(most important): The dataset should have motivational types of conversations or WHICH TRIES TO RAISE HOPE IN THE DYING PATIENT. A POSSIBLE SEARCH COULD BE: MOTIVATIONAL CONVERSATION-BASED DATASETS
Deciding the type of method which should be followed while implementing the chatbot
Intro Resources(First, Knowing How We Could Build the chatbot):

Methods
Building from scratch:
E.g., Conversation Chatbot for Disease Diagnosis
https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3511808.3557296?casa_token=pTjbmUA66f0AAAAA:qy808O9hZN3dILi9qErpHA6BDW5Az3BTYwoluZ6OOxl2ETXhWzdbZihamxNk32wCJy2VpsKdCt8 
Implementing all three components(it is multimodal, but the image part could be ignored, and we just need to change the dataset and the rest of the implementation remains the same):
NLU - bert, DM - RL agent
https://aclanthology.org/P18-2033.pdf  (only DM part Implementation as RL)

Our Task Specific Resources
https://www.fingerprintforsuccess.com/blog/mental-health-chatbot mentions the mental health chatbots which help to deal with problems
From the mentioned chatbots, I tried out one Youper, it is like a flowchart where the user only gets fixed options to respond, and the output is fixed for each response. To test the robustness of the text-based answers, I am writing different inputs than expected. It considers those outputs to be ideal and generates the next ideal question.
But the point is there exist CHATBOTS FOR MENTAL HEALTH.

General resources(could be leveraged for any problem):
There is also one framework: RASA (https://rasa.com/ )
In this framework, we just have to put the data in the required format, and then it performs all other actions.
Here intents are

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lwddP0KUEg using neural networks
NLU and DM - identifying the words which were present during the training time and putting those places as one and then feeding that vector of the sentence(representing the words of the sentence which were present during the training time) into a neural network that predicts the class or intent in which it falls. Then THE OUTPUT IS DEFINED IN THE TRAINING DATA, WHICH SHOULD BE FOR THAT PARTICULAR INTENT.


DATASET
Task-oriented: 
WORTH RESOURCE: Therapy-based data (? conversations) https://towardsdatascience.com/counsel-chat-bootstrapping-high-quality-therapy-data-971b419f33da 
https://github.com/nbertagnolli/counsel-chat/tree/master/data
Data from counseling websites where a person enters their questions, then any THERAPIST ANSWERS THE QUESTION. So we can train our model from this dataset.
